# Moonshot
Multiple view app containing information about Apollo missions.
It is an app from Paul Hudson's 100DaysOfSwiftUI course, all descriptions come from wikipedia. I haven't included an asset catalog nor .xcodeproj file.

Main app view with two visibility views: grid (on the 1st picture) and a list view (on the 2nd picture) :

Linked mission view (mission logo at the top, and crew list at the bottom with linked bio) : 3rd picture

Astronauts bio view: 4th picture
